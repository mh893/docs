Here’s an updated explanation with the addition of **Templates** and **manager-specific access control**:

In **Cartha**, a **planning version** is a snapshot of your workforce or personnel cost plan for a specific point in time or scenario. It serves as the foundation for forecasting, budgeting, and collaboration across departments.

### **Key elements of a planning version:**

1. **Scenario-based**

   Create different versions for planning use cases like:
   - “Baseline 2025”
   - “Hiring Freeze Q3”
   - “Growth Plan – Sales Expansion”
2. **Data container**

   A planning version holds:
   - Planned and actual positions
   - Salaries, employer costs, bonuses
   - Start dates, cost centers, departments, entities
   - Custom attributes specific to your org
3. **Templates (for manager collaboration)**

   To involve department heads or cost center managers, you can assign them **templates** that grant access to only their relevant slice of the data — for example:
   - A Marketing Manager only sees positions in Marketing cost centers
   - A regional lead only sees data for a specific legal entity or location

   This ensures that managers can **review, adjust, or propose plans** for their area — without seeing sensitive or irrelevant information.
4. **Comparison & tracking**

   You can compare planning versions to:
   - Measure forecast vs. actual
   - Analyze changes across scenarios
   - Track progress across cycles (e.g. quarterly updates)
5. **Edit control**

   Versions can be:
   - **Editable** for live planning sessions
   - **Locked** to preserve baselines or snapshots used in reporting

**In summary**:

A planning version in Cartha is a secure, flexible workspace for workforce planning — with templates that let managers contribute without breaking structure or visibility rules.
